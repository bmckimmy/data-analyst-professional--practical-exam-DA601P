# Practical Exam - Product Sales
About Pens and Printers

Pens and Printers was founded in 1984 and provides high quality office products to large organizations. We are a trusted provider of everything from pens and notebooks to desk chairs and monitors. We don’t produce our own products but sell those made by other companies.

We have built long lasting relationships with our customers and they trust us to provide them with the best products for them. As the way in which consumers buy products is changing, our sales tactics have to change too. Launching a new product line is expensive and we need to make sure we are using the best techniques to sell the new product effectively. The best approach may vary for each new product so we need to learn quickly what works and what doesn’t.

# New Product Sales Methods

Six weeks ago we launched a new line of office stationery. Despite the world becoming increasingly digital, there is still demand for notebooks, pens and sticky notes.

Our focus has been on selling products to enable our customers to be more creative, focused on tools for brainstorming. We have tested three different sales strategies for this, targeted email and phone calls, as well as combining the two.

Email: Customers in this group received an email when the product line was launched, and a further email three weeks later. This required very little work for the team.

Call: Customers in this group were called by a member of the sales team. On average members of the team were on the phone for around thirty minutes per customer.

Email and call: Customers in this group were first sent the product information email, then called a week later by the sales team to talk about their needs and how this new product may support their work. The email required little work from the team, the call was around ten minutes per customer.
